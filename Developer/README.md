# Developer

Scripts, skills, and other development tools. Some scripts work with Raycast if you add this repository as a "Script Commands" directory from within "Extensions".

**Tracking policy:**

- This directory uses an allowlist `.gitignore`; only files and directories explicitly un-ignored are tracked
- To track a new script, add it to `.gitignore` (e.g., `!scripts/new-script.sh`)
- To track a new skill, add entries for both the directory and its contents to `.gitignore` (e.g., `!skills/new-skill/` and `!skills/new-skill/**`)
