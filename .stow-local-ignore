# This one's special: codex-cli doesn't support symlinked files.
# So we can't symlink to the absolute `~/Developer/skills` folder since
# after stowing with --no-folding, that will only contain symlinked files.
# Instead, we symlink to the `~/dotfiles` one directly where we use a gitinclude stragety,
# which lets us add additional skills without tracking them in git unless explicitely allowed.
# The only remaining piece is to ensure we don't stow those non-public skills.
